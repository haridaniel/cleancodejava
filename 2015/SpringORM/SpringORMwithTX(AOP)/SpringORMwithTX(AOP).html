	<h3>Spring 4 ORM example with JPA, Hibernate, AOP Transactions</h3>
	<p>This is a very simple example that shows you how to configure an
		application with Spring that uses</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dependency Injection (@Autowired annotation),</li>
		<li>JPA EntityManager (provided by Hibernate),</li>
		<li>Transactional methods (AOP configured).&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To configure the transactional methods we do not use @Transactional annotations now because we use aspect oriented approach in this example (we can say all methods in the service package starting with
		&quot;get&quot; is a read-only transactional method). 
		<br> <br>(For @Transactional annotatated approach please check this tutorial:
		http://www.journaldev.com/7655/spring-orm-example-with-jpa-hibernate-<br>transactions)
		<br> <br>We use in-memory database for this example to simplify, so no need for any database setup. This is a standalone application example.
	</p>
	<p>The project structure:</p>
	<p>(picture here)</p>
	<p>We go through these files one by one and explain them:</p>
	<p>1. Maven dependencies</p>
	<p>We will first look into our pom.xml file for all the required
		dependencies and their versions. We have used Spring 4, and Hibernate
		4 in this example.</p>

	<br>Service Class As you can see there are no @Transactional
	annotations here, but we want these methods to run in transactions. The
	reason is that we use AOP approach for transactional methods, that we
	will configure easily later in spring.xml.
